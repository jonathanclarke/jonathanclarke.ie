title: Day 8 of 300 - Sore and feeling down
excerpt: "Day 8 of 300 - There is no such thing as a free lunch unless you have a Nepalese mother-in-law. Yesterday’s run triggered a 'check engine' light in my right quad, so I treated it with a 'medical' bike ride at 95 bpm to unglue the fibers. It worked, but by 2:00 PM, the systemic fatigue hit. I cancelled the afternoon walk. In the past, I would have beaten myself up; today, I recognize it as data. The leg is saved, but the energy is low."

There is no such thing as a free lunch unless you have a Nepalese mother-in-law.  If you push a system beyond its capacity, you generate heat and wear. Eventually, you have to pay the bill.

Yesterday, I pushed myself. I ran a continuous 22-minute threshold run at a slow pace, apparently a pace my body wasn't conditioned for yet.

This morning my right quad was tight, seizing up just above the knee.  It wasn't an injury yet but it was a warning light flashing on the dashboard. A classic "Check Engine" signal.  A dash of DFO was applied to the leg and I stretched a little bit.

I had two choices: rest completely and let the leg stiffen up, or use the bike as a physiotherapy tool. I chose the latter, but with strict rules: no torque, not crazy exertion.

I treated this ride like a medical procedure. The goal wasn't fitness; it was blood flow. I needed to unglue the muscle fibers without stressing them.

The Data:

Time: 1 Hour

Distance: 19.84 km

Heart Rate: 95 bpm

Look at that heart rate. 95 bpm.  Some say that it takes more mental discipline to ride that slowly than it does to ride fast.  I was just super tired.  I kept the resistance at zero and just spun my legs. It worked. By the time I unclipped, the "cramp" feeling was gone. The leg was loose.

I had planned to walk the dogs this afternoon to keep the step count up. I didn't make it out the door.

Around 2:00 PM, the adrenaline wore off and the cumulative fatigue of non-stop training hit me. I wasn't injured, I wasn't sore.  I was just deeply, systemically tired.  So, I cancelled the walk.

In the past, I would have beaten myself up for "missing" a session. Now, I recognize it for what it is: data. The body is demanding resources to repair the damage from the last week. If I force the walk, I dig a deeper hole. If I rest, I bounce back.

The leg is saved hopefully. The energy is low. I live to fight on.
