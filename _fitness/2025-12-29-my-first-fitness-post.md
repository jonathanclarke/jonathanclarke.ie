Following on from [Project 300](/2025/12/26/300-days.html); I've taken the first step, getting off my ass and onto the exercise bike. 

Christmas was a lovely time spent with a lot of friends, absent from my Irish family but together with my Nepalese chosen family. Not much alcohol consumed, I was too busy running up and down the stairs making sure the fire did not go out.

The past few years I've been adding intermittent fasting posts and fitness posts to mastodon and twitter but I'm going to start migrating everything over here instead. 

- 20 km bike ride in 60 minutes - easy but I had to stop half way through to format a computer.
