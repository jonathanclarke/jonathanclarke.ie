I joined my daughters for a swim for the first time in months at the heated pool. They’re only five years old - still learning to doggy paddle, but getting more confident in the water every day. For the first time, both of them can touch the bottom of the pool with their toes.

Amazeballs.

The day also came with a solid dose of movement:

- A 5 km run on the treadmill at the American Club

- A 20 km bike ride back home in 60 minutes

Later, I had the chance to catch up with some friends. I abstained from alcohol - but not from the food on offer. Absolutely delicious.

I’ll be doing this much more often as we head into the new year.
