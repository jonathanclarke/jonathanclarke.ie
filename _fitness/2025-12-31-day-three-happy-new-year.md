I dropped my daughters off for a swimming lesson this morning: 30 minutes in the pool for each of them for a total of $15. What a bargain. I’m really looking forward to them getting comfortable in the water, especially for safety’s sake.

Since it is New Year's Eve, I decided to duck into the American Club’s gym to see how busy it was. It was empty, though my guess is that tomorrow will be a totally different story.

I logged 6.18 km on the treadmill with an average pace of 9:43/km and an average heart rate of 136 bpm. It all awaits again tomorrow. It took an hour and burned 683 calories.  All in all not a bad way to end the year.

I also added a 65-minute session on my indoor bike, covering 22.73 km with an average speed of 21 km/h. 

Tonight, a beautiful thali awaits with friends before I join my family to ring in the New Year. 296 more days to go. Happy New Year everyone.
