Happy New Year.  Welcome to 2026.

Let's be real about January 1st. Usually, this is a write-off day. You wake up groggy, the holiday momentum crashes into a wall of fatigue, and the "New Year, New Me" energy hasn't quite kicked in yet.

I didn't exactly set myself up for success last night. There was a beer (just one, but still), some pizza, and plenty of Nepalese snacks. My sleep score was trash - about 4 hours.

I'm pushing for consistency, especially on the days I really don't want to do it.

I dragged myself to the gym expecting a disaster. I assumed my heart rate would be sky-high and my legs would feel like lead.

The data says otherwise.

* **Distance:** 6.31 km
* **Pace:** 9:31 /km (Faster than yesterday)
* **Heart Rate:** 134 bpm

Maybe it was the "carb-loading" (read: pizza) from last night, or maybe the salt from the snacks kept the cramps away, but I seem to have run cleaner than expected. I felt fine.

The day then got away from me. Family commitments, holiday chaos, life stuff. By the time I had a free moment, it was late. The excuses were right there: *"I already ran 6k this morning,"* or *"I'll just double up tomorrow."*

But that's how the slide starts. You skip one hard session, then an easy one, and suddenly it’s February and you haven't trained in a week.

So, I got on to the bike.

* **Time:** 1 Hour (exactly)
* **Heart Rate:** 107 bpm

I didn't push it. I kept the resistance low and stuck on a movie. A heart rate of 107 bpm isn't about building fitness; it's about flushing the system. It's about spinning the legs to get rid of the stiffness from the run and just logging the hours.

We are four days in. The holidays are over. Now the real grind begins.  Welcome to 2026.
