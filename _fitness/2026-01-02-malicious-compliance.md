Yesterday I set my Garmin watch up for a C25K training event (Couch to 5k).  I want to be able to eventually run continuously for 5km before I take a break.  I had forgotten that Garmin decided today was the day for a "Benchmark Run" - a short, 9-minute test to calibrate my fitness level.

For a beginner, 9 minutes is a workout but after the week I've had 9 minutes is a warm-up.  I followed the protocol. I did the 9 minutes. I ran (9:12/km pace), attempted to keep my heart rate low (125 bpm), and let the watch collect its data.

Then, I engaged in a little malicious compliance.

I didn't stop. I took exactly 2 minutes of rest, hit "Start" again, and stacked a full 5.75 km run on top of the benchmark.

**The Morning Data:**

* **Total Time:** 64 Minutes
* **Total Distance:** 6.73 km
* **Average Pace:** 9:34 /km
* **Heart Rate:** 135 bpm

At 3:30 PM, I stopped eating.

I’m currently 109kg. To move this needle, I need to pull bigger levers than just "eating clean." I need a system reset. So, I initiated a **24-Hour Intermittent Fast**.

The last meal was substantial—Rice, Dahl, homemade Curry, and a bacon sandwich. A "Last Supper" designed to fuel what came next.

Most people use Friday night to unwind. I used it to empty the tank.

I knew that if I sat on the couch, the 3:30 PM fast would feel impossible by 8:00 PM. The only way to beat the hunger is to be too busy to notice it.

I got on the bike for the second workout.

**The Evening Data:**

* **Duration:** 80 Minutes (New Project Record)
* **Distance:** 27.19 km
* **Calories:** 503 kcal

**The Daily Totals:**

* **Distance:** 33.92 km
* **Calories Burned:** ~1,254 kcal
* **Time Moving:** 2 Hours 24 Minutes

I am writing this deep into the fast. The glycogen from lunch is gone, burned off by that 80-minute ride. Hopefully, my body has no choice but to switch fuel sources.

Five days in.  No excuses.  Saturday is officially a rest day, my first all week.
