title: Day 7 of 300 - Grinding in the dark thinking of cheese
excerpt: "Day 7 of 300 - It’s 9:30 PM. You’re full of cheese and Thali, tired from a birthday celebration, and the day is effectively over. The logical decision is to go to bed. I didn't do the logical thing. Garmin called for a 'Recovery Run,' but I accidentally executed a threshold test instead. Here is the data from Day 8. A session that proves the perfect time to train is a myth, and sometimes you just have to grind in the dark."

There is a specific moment that kills most fitness resolutions. It isn't the early morning alarm; it’s the late-night hurdle.

It’s 9:30 PM. You’ve just finished a friend's birthday celebration. You’ve eaten cheese, bread, and had an enormously large Thali lunch. You are full, tired, and the day is effectively over. The logical decision is to go to bed and promise to "double up" tomorrow.

I didn't do the logical thing. I put my shoes and shorts on after getting the kids to bed.

I stepped onto the treadmill intending to do a light check-the-box run. Garmin suggested a "Recovery Run" because it thinks I've been overreaching (it's not wrong and hasn't been for the past 5 days).

I accepted the suggestion, but I misread the assignment.  I ended up running 22 minutes non-stop—skipping the walk breaks entirely.

## The "Recovery run" Data:

Distance: 2.66 km

Pace: 8:20 /km (More than a minute faster than usual)

Heart Rate: 151 bpm

That 151 bpm isn't recovery. That is Threshold. I accidentally executed a performance test on a Tuesday night with a stomach full of curry and cheese.

By the time I stepped off the treadmill, my nervous system was lit up. You can't go to sleep with a heart rate that high, and you certainly can't let that lactic acid sit in your legs overnight.

So, I got on the bike to finish the job.

## The Cycle Data:

Time: 1 Hour

Distance: 21.02 km

Heart Rate: 112 bpm

This wasn't about fitness; it was about management. I kept the heart rate low (112 bpm) to signal my body to calm down. It was a mechanical flush to undo the damage of the run and process the sodium from the day's food.

The Daily Totals:

Total Time: ~1 Hour 22 Minutes

Total Distance: 23.68 km

I finished this workout just before midnight. The perfect time to train is a myth. Sometimes you just have to grind in the dark.
