title: Day 9 of 300 - Back on track
excerpt: "Day 9 of 300 - After a scare with a tight quad yesterday, today was the real test.  I needed to know if I was actually injured or just stiff.  I put the leg through a 5km run and a 22km bike ride to find out. The verdict? Zero pain, faster pace, and 27.37 km banked for the day. Taking it easy yesterday paid off - I'm back to full speed."

### Part 1: The Load Test (Morning Run)

Yesterday I took a bit of a break, no run, no energy but I did get the hour of cycling done.   This morning I took the myself for a 5km trial using the "Week 2" C25K protocol (1 minute Run / 1 minute 30 seconds Walk). I needed to see if the stress of running would trigger that tightness above the knee again.

**The Run Data:**

* **Distance:** 5.01 km
* **Total Time:** 46:18
* **Average Pace:** 9:15 /km
* **Average Heart Rate:** 132 bpm

### Part 2: Full Capacity Confirmation (Afternoon Cycle)

With the all clear signal from the morning run, I was cleared to complete the double.

Yesterday, I rode at a meager 95 bpm with zero resistance to protect the leg. Today, I needed to confirm that I could return to a standard training load without issues.

**The Cycle Data:**

* **Distance:** 22.36 km
* **Time:** 1:00:06
* **Average Heart Rate:** 116 bpm


Encouraging. My pace is faster (9:15 /km) and my heart rate is lower (132 bpm) than previous similar sessions, indicating improved aerobic efficiency. But data doesn't feel pain.

The real metric for this morning wasn't on the watch. It was the sensation in the leg during impact. The verdict? No pain at all.

The difference between yesterday's 95 bpm flush and today's 116 bpm effort is significant. It confirms that yesterday was just a temporary blip. I'm back to full operating capacity.

**Day 10 Totals:**

* **Total Distance:** 27.37 km
* **Total Time:** 1 Hour 46 Minutes

I dodged a bullet by listening to the warning signs early. Now, it's time to get back to work.
