title: Day 10 of 300 - Power cut - The Kathmandu reality check
excerpt: "Day 10 of 300 - Everything was going to plan until the lights went out. I banked a solid 20km recovery ride and was 16 minutes into my run when Kathmandu’s grid intervened. The power cut locked the treadmill instantly, sending me flying. Thankfully, no injuries; just a bruised ego and a sudden end to the session."

Not every training day goes according to the plan. Sometimes, shit happens.

Day 10 started perfectly planned. I banked a solid hour on the bike in the morning. It was an intentionally easy spin, keeping my average heart rate way down at 98 bpm just to build volume without stress. I covered just over 20km and felt ready for the second part of the double in the afternoon.

I stepped onto the treadmill for my scheduled 5km run/walk workout. Everything was smooth for the first 16 minutes; I was just nicely warmed up with a heart rate of 117 bpm.

Then, Kathmandu happened.  I was stopped in my tracks.

An unexpected power cut hit the building. When a treadmill loses electricity at speed, the belt doesn't glide to a stop; it locks instantly. Momentum took over, and I took a fall.

Thankfully, there were no injuries. The only damage was to my patience. I was incredibly annoyed not to finish the session, but I decided to listen to the universe and call it a day right there.

**Day 10 Totals:**

* **Time:** 1 Hour 16 Minutes
* **Distance:** 22.63 km

It wasn't the full workout I planned, but it's work in the bank. Tomorrow is a new day, hopefully with electricity.
