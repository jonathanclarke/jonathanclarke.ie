Life has a habit of expanding to fill the available space.  In the past, fitness was an "optional event".  It was something I tried to squeeze into the margins of the day.  If I was busy, with meetings, or had an event to attend, the workout was the always first thing to get cut.

Project 300 is about flipping that logic. Fitness is no longer a variable; it is a constant.  The day doesn't dictate the workout; the workout dictates the day. Events, meetings, and "busyness" have to fit into the gaps left behind by the training, not the other way around.

I woke up early this morning with a point to prove. It was technically a rest day, but I wanted to test myself. For the last week, I’ve been strictly following a run/walk interval structure.  Today, I wanted to know:  Could I handle the full 17-minute duration at a continuous pace?  17 is the number of 1 minute runs I was completing in each of my workouts the past 2 weeks. 

I set out to do a "reduced pace" jog—just turning the legs over without spiking the heart rate.

* **Time:** 17:18
* **Distance:** 2.13 km
* **Average Pace:** 8:08 /km
* **Average Heart Rate:** 140 bpm

The telemetry tells a funny story.  I thought I was jogging slowly. In reality, I may have been flying. (for my fitness pace at least)

Comparing this run to my "Threshold Run" from Tuesday (Jan 6), the improvement is stark. On Tuesday, I ran at **8:20 /km** with a heart rate of **151 bpm**.  Today, I ran **12 seconds faster per kilometer (8:08 /km)**, yet my heart rate was **11 beats lower (140 bpm)**.

I have accidentally leveled up. What felt "hard" four days ago now feels "easy," even though I am actually moving faster.

The right quad, which gave me a scare earlier in the week, was silent.  It handled the speed without complaint.  However, the increased speed and the lack of walking breaks transferred the load to the next weakest link: the left shin.

There is a slight ache there now; a reminder that while the heart is ready for speed, the bones are still adapting to the impact.  It’s a game of physiological Whack-a-Mole.  I’ll ice it, rest it, and be ready for Day 12.  Now I have a conference to attend; mission complete.
