This week, "Project 300" moved from the treadmill to the Himalayas. A 3-day trek to introduce my kids to the mountains.

## Day 1: The Ascent - Ghatte Khola to Dhampus (Uphill)

Time: 2 Hours 26 Minutes

Distance: 3.74 km

Avg Heart Rate: 115 bpm

Energy Cost: 1,057 kcal

Analysis: The 'gravity tax' was high. Climbing required continuous concentric muscle contraction, keeping my heart rate in a steady aerobic conditioning zone (115 bpm) for 2.5 hours. This was effectively a 150-minute resistance workout.

## Day 2: The Volume - Australian Camp Ridge Lines (Rolling Terrain)

Total Time: ~2 Hours 30 Minutes

Avg Heart Rate: 97–106 bpm

Analysis: This was 'Time on Feet.' By staying on the ridges, I accumulated volume with a low cardiac cost (Zone 1/2). This builds durability in connective tissues (tendons/ligaments) without adding systemic fatigue.

## Day 3: The Descent - Dhampus to Ghatte Khola (Downhill)

Time: 2 Hours 10 Minutes

Distance: 3.74 km (Same as Day 1)

Avg Heart Rate: 93 bpm

Energy Cost: 650 kcal

Analysis: Comparing Day 1 to Day 3 reveals the mechanics:

Efficiency: Gravity assisted the movement, dropping Heart Rate by 22 bpm and reducing calorie burn by ~400 kcal compared to the ascent.

Mechanical Stress: While the heart rested, my quads worked harder.  The descent relies on eccentric loading (lengthening under tension) to act as brakes.  This reinforces knee stability if performed with control.

In conclusion, my work to date on the treadmill helped enormously; I went much slower because well, I was with my kids.  I didn't feel stressed at all and at times felt I could have run up or down the mountain. Next time I'll be in this area will be for the Fishtail half marathon; onwards.
