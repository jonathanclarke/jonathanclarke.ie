I forgot my watch today, so I ran based on feel rather than chasing numbers. Interestingly, the data suggests I run better when I'm not watching the clock.

I stuck to my standard 1:1 interval structure (1 minute run, 1 minute walk) on the treadmill.  I will continue this for the week.

Today (No Watch): 8:49 /km pace (4.99 km in 44:00).

Yesterday (With Watch): 9:01 /km pace.

The Result: I ran 12 seconds per kilometer faster today simply by listening to my body instead of the beeps.

For the second session, I focused on a flush ride—keeping the resistance flat to recover from yesterday's heavy intervals.

Today (Recovery): 19.77 km at 100 bpm average heart rate.

Yesterday (Intervals): 16.80 km at 116 bpm average heart rate.

I rode 3 km further than yesterday, but with a significantly lower heart rate (-16 bpm). This is efficient volume: gaining distance without adding stress to the body.  I also rode with zero resistance just to get the legs moving.  Another day, another double.  Onwards.

## Day 16 Totals:

- Run: 4.99 km
- Bike: 19.77 km
