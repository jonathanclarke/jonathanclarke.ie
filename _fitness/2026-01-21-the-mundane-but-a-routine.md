title: "Day 17 of 300 - The mundane, but a routine"
excerpt: "Day 17 of 300 - Often the mundane and the routine usually feels like a cage, but lately, it feels like a key.  The run, the dog walk, the daily sweat - it's beginning to stop feeling like a tax I have to pay and started feeling like a source I get to tap into.  I'm finding joy in the simple ability to move, and for the first time in a long time, my body is responding."

I clicked the wrong button today. Instead of my standard 1:1 intervals (1 min run, 1 min walk), I accidentally selected a 1:1.30 ratio. I unknowingly gave myself 50% more rest.

The result was a physiological bargain.

    Monday (Standard): 9:01 /km pace @ 141 bpm.

    Today (Mistake): 9:08 /km pace @ 132 bpm.

By adding 30 seconds of walking, I only lost 7 seconds of pace but saved 9 beats per minute on my heart rate. I ran harder during the "on" phases and recovered deeper during the "off" phases.

Then rode for 60 minutes on the indoor bike for 21.87 km.

Often the mundane and the routine usually feels like a cage, but lately, it feels like a key.  The run, the dog walk, the daily sweat - it's beginning to stop feeling like a tax I have to pay and started feeling like a source I get to tap into.  I'm finding joy in the simple ability to move, and for the first time in a long time, my body is responding.

Sometimes the wrong button is the right move. Who knew?  Onwards.
