Completely forgot to blog for the past 2 days.

Both days i just trained for a single session.

## 21 January

For the first time I pushed the run session to a full 60 minutes. Instead of stopping after the intervals, I tacked on 26 minutes of steady-state walking.

There was a significant discrepancy between my watch and the treadmill.

- Garmin Data: 6.3 km
- Treadmill Data: 6.82 km

My watch short-changed me by nearly 600 meters.  Accelerometers often struggle to track distance accurately on slat-belt treadmills because the belt absorbs the impact differently than asphalt.  Calories burned: 700+

# 22 January

Again, up early this morning and went straight to the gym after dropping the dogs off.

I recalibrated my watch to match the treadmill and completed the 5km in 42 minutes; I felt this could have been much faster as I started walking at the end with 17 intervals having been completed.  From next week I'll increase the intervals to hit 5km so I am running consistantly.

Despite missing the bike session yesterday and again today due to family commitments, the morning run delivered a massive return on investment. Garmin flagged it as a new personal record, Yay I guess.

The weekend promises to deliver two indoor bike sessions, some tennis and lots of sunshine.  Winter in Nepal, gotta love it.
