I walked into the gym today feeling drained and after 24 minutes, I decided to pull the plug early, stopping at just 3 kilometers. It felt like a failed session.

But Garmin tells a different story.

Yesterday, I set a new personal record with an average pace of **8:25 /km**. Today, despite feeling worse, I ran at **8:08 /km**.

I didn't stop because I was weak; I stopped because I was running **17 seconds per kilometer faster** than my best effort. My body gave me a burst of speed, but it didn't have the energy to sustain it for the full distance.

**The Stats:**

* **Distance:** 3.01 km
* **Time:** 24:30
* **Pace:** 8:08 /km


Today's run felt like an interrogation.  I spent every minute probing, looking for a green light, but the signals were chaotic.  I think I also looked for any signal to quit.

One moment, the rhythm felt sustainable - this is fine, keep going. The next, I was fighting down a wave of nausea.  Then came the structural warning: a sharp, specific twinge in the calf that whispered of injury.

I usually try to bargain with discomfort, to negotiate for "just one more minute, push.". But today, the internal monologue wasn't a debate. It was a verdict.  My body didn't say "slow down." It said "Stop."

And for the first time in a long time, I listened.  Another session awaits tomorrow.
