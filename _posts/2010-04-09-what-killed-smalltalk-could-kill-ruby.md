## Overview of this presentation

* Smalltalk & Ruby are deeply interrelated.

* Much of the same syntax between the two languages

* From 1970s Smalltalk was the language to watch

* Smalltalk epitomized Object Orientated Design

* Described C++ as a mans language (need balls to code in it and make it work)

* Describes Java as an estrogen type language (presuming he means only women code in it?)

* Smalltalk had a productivity benefit of a factor of 5. Compared to a C application.

* Refactoring in Smalltalk was a breeze

* What killed Smalltalk? ( umm, at this stage I have no idea, he jumps to a new topic)

* Definition of clean code - "when you look at a routine and its pretty much what you expected"

* Best metric for clean code is 0 WTFs per minute

* What killed Smalltalk is that it was just too easy to make a mess (Finally, 20 mins in!) Quote from Ward Cunningham

* So easy to make an indirect and impenetrable system over time

* Companies developing in Smalltalk were screwed up at the time

* You can make a mess in Ruby, simple, elegant, wonderful language; still easy to make a mess

* Projects in Ruby start well, but the framework is often violated over time; making a mess...

* Boyscout rule, leave the campground cleaner than when you entered it. (Actual quote - leave life better than you found it) - apply this to your source code. Would make code get better and better as time goes by. Most of the time, cleaning code is hard!

* Quote of the presentation - "If you touch it, you will break it. If you break it, it becomes yours. The best policy is to walk away, run. the messes are hard to clean"

* Test Driven Development is the solution

* Rails and Ruby is great for Test Driven Development.

* Other languages have TDD, was born in Smalltalk.

* Talks about TDD methods; If you follow TDD, regularly write and run tests, then there is no fear to change code.

* Nothing makes a system more maintainable than a suite of tests

* He loves Rspec and Cucumber (Behaviour Driven Development BDD)

* TDD never really became a part of Smalltalks culture but is integral to the Ruby community

* TDD will keep your code clean

* There was an arrogance to the Smalltalk community ( I sometimes can see this in the Ruby community )

* Our tools are so good, our language is so good we don't need to follow the rules. Smalltalk people didn't want to do regular programming (Enterprise Applications, etc)

* Your language may be powerful, but you must be careful with it. just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily mean we must do that thing (Star Trek quote) Us vs them feeling in the Smalltalk community.

* Ruby community is not going to go down this path because:

* Discipline - TDD makes you feel good inside

* Professionalism - did the doctor wash their hands, did you write your tests?

* Acceptance - we need to solve the dirty problems ( Need to adapt to the enterprises needs - do not solve only the problems you like.)

* We have a great tool in Ruby, we can kill it, let's not do that!

## My view

Great presentation style, he's quite funny. Very inspirational lecturer for developers confirming that TDD/BDD are the ways forward for software engineering.
