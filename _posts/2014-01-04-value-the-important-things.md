	"Happiness is a bowl of cherries and a book of poetry under a shady tree" - Astrid Alauda

What makes a person happy is unique.  My happy zone involves a hammock with a great book enjoying fantastic weather. Life is much to short to sweat the little things. 

Find what makes you happy and do it regularly.  No-one ever wished that they worked more on their death bed.
