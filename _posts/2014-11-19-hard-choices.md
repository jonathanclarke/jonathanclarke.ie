I've been working on a new site called Pasa.io for a while now.  It's a marketplace for low income countries.   We've come up against a barrier where a mobile application makes sense for our partners in Nepal.  The problem is this; they are all stuck on really crappy mobile phones that run Android 2.1 and up.  I'm fairly certain I saw much lower spec phones running over there.  Not a single iphone in sight.

So we have a choice, alienate a significant chunk of our user base and don't actively develop for them or build a substandard app. 

We're looking at cordova + angular js vs a native android build for API 8.  Hard choices that very few developers will ever have to make!  #developer-problems
