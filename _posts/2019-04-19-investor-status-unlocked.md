title: Investor status, Unlocked!
---

For the past number of years I've been based with my wife in Kathmandu, Nepal.  We relocated here soon after the earthquake, uprooting our lives in Sydney to return to my wifes country, a place she hadn't lived in for over 20 years.

I've wanted to help Nepal in whatever way I could, my way was through software skills.  Being an engineer for such a long time I've picked up a few things over the years, tools and methodologies that I've used to make my life much easier.   I wanted to train a team of engineers in Nepal these tools and techniques so that their lives and their families lives could improve.

I'm delighted to say that my application to become a foreign investor in Nepal was approved.

My goal is to have a high tech organisation in Nepal training local hires and giving them the skills they need to drag Nepal kicking and screaming into the 21st century.
