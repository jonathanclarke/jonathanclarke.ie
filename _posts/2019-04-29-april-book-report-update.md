***Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou***
Pretty great story about how a sociopath builds a biotech business, with the aid of her reality distortion field and buckets loads of cash dupes a lot of VCs and old retail giants in the process.  Siemens did pretty well out of it though, Theranos was one of their biggest customers building an illusion on top of Siemens technology.  Was a great read, the story is still on going with court cases and movies coming out.  This yarn isn't over by a long stretch. 


***Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin***
Commenced reading this one as Army of None hadn't copied over and I was impatient.  I last remember reading this as a boy of 8, it was first printed in 1968, an oldie but a goodie. Arrogant boy learns magic, losses a horrible shadow into the world with one of his spells, becomes humble, destroys shadow.  In doing so becomes the most powerful wizard of Earthsea.  What's not to like.

***Army of None by Paul Scharre***
Seeing as I didn't get around to this yet this is next on my list. 


***The Sparrow: A Novel by Mary Doria Russell***
Looking forward to this one. If you have to send a group of people to a newly discovered planet to contact a totally unknown species, whom would you choose? How about four Jesuit priests, a young astronomer, a physician, her engineer husband, and a child prostitute-turned-computer-expert? That's who Mary Doria Russell sends in her new novel, The Sparrow. This motley combination of agnostics, true believers, and misfits becomes the first to explore the Alpha Centuri world of Rakhat with both enlightening and disastrous results.
