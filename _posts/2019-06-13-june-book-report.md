***The Sparrow: A Novel by Mary Doria Russell***
So the synopsis I gave earlier in a previous blog post really doesn't do this book justice.  I really quite enjoyed aspects of this read, it wasn't a slog by any means but there were points in the book where I had to do a double take, track back a chapter or two and realise that a single phrasing changed the entire storyline having missed it previously.  Having been taught by a few Jesuits in my time and spent a lot of time around Jesuits I was quite interested in much of the scientific aspects of the Jesuit approach to faith.  Definitely on my recommendation list. 

***The Spy Who Came in from the Cold by John le Carré***
This is a 1963 Cold War spy novel by the British author John le Carré. It depicts Alec Leamas, a British agent, being sent to East Germany as a faux defector to sow disinformation about a powerful East German intelligence officer.  "What do you think spies are: priests, saints, martyrs? They're a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors, too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives."  The inner thoughts of a spy are exposed to the reader as he is sent under-cover mission of revenge but in fact the unwitting tool of even cleverer British brains with other motives.
