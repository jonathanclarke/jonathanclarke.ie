title: Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson
---

A great book for any small business owner, something that many executives in larger companies could possibly adopt.  
	
	
	“If you build software, every error message is marketing” 
	
The advice by the founders is for founders, who want to keep their companies out of VC hands, small, lean and nimble.

	
	“Workaholics aren't heroes. They don't save the day, they just use it up. The real hero is home because she figured out a faster way”


I've already recommended this book to a number of people and I definitely plan to keep doing so.


	“Until you actually start making something, your brilliant idea is just that, an idea.”
