title: Software to make the world a better place
---

We want to 'make the world a better place'.  It's a phrase I 'secretly' hate seeing in pitch sessions as it just simply sounds disengenuous.  Making the world a better place and raking in big stacks are often at odds with each other.

I came across a wonderful project developed by some Irish university students today.  'Field of vision' essentially utilises AI and a hardware devise to allow the visually impaired to immerse themselves in live sports.

The AI allows real time ball tracking and gives the position on the device to the fingertips of the person using it.  It's a wonderful application of applying technology they've learned for the benefit of humanity.

    FOV will enable visually impaired fans to touch, hear, and feel the excitement of a sports match as it unfolds before them.

I really love to see projects like this especially from any student.  I'm a firm believer that students who are studying any form of technology should have at least one module where they work on a project that will benefit humanity.  It's important that they can apply themselves to the hard problems before they're daunted by what is and what is not possible early on.

Just taking a few months to tackle daunting issues that we face will bring new perspectives but it may also lead to new innovations.  That could only be a good thing.
