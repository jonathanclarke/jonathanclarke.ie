It's been a while, hasnâ€™t it? The last time I sat down to write a blog post was just about two years ago, right around the time my startup Conx.co was acquired by Houzz.com. A lot has changed since then, and if you're wondering why my online voice has been conspicuously silent, I'm not really here to share the whirlwind of the last 24 months.

As much as I hate to admit it, the relentless pace over the past two years has taken a toll on me, both professionally and personally. Balancing work with personal life became a challenge, and something had to give. Unfortunately, that meant my blogging and a few other hobbies. To add to the challenges, this year, I faced some health setbacks which served as a stark reminder that we are not invincible and that self-care is paramount.

In all honesty, I miss the old days when I could spontaneously jot down my thoughts and share updates without second-guessing. But I also recognize that growth, both personal and professional, often comes with trade-offs.

Facing health issues amidst a demanding work environment made me reevaluate my priorities. It taught me the significance of slowing down when needed and the importance of listening to one's body and mind. While recovery and regaining my strength have been a journey, it has given me time to reflect on what truly matters.

That said, I'm making a commitment to reconnect with this space. While I might have ever been in recent years a frequent writer, this is a place where I want to explore, learn and hopefully teach others. 

Thank you for sticking around, for your understanding, and for your well wishes. I am grateful for the support I've received from many of you. Here's to more stories in the future, hopefully with a healthier and more balanced me at the helm!
