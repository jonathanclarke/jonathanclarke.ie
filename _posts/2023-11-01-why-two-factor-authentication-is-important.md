title: "Hey Facebook, Two factor authentication is still important"
excerpt: "In the latest swing of the 'convenience versus security' pendulum, Facebook seems poised to let users disable two-factor authentication (2FA) on certain devices, potentially undermining the bedrock of account security. What are they thinking?"

I rarely use Facebook.  On the 5th July 2019 I removed all of my friends from my account and became officially friendless.  I maintain a presence however to manage apps for some hobby projects as well as a point of contact for distant family relatives who seem to have no idea on how to use WhatsApp.

I logged in today to my browser to find some gym membership fees and I was faced with a notification.   The message was innocent sounding but set off alarm bells.

	Soon, you'll no longer need two-factor authentication on certain devices. Manage this in settings
  	
In an era where digital security breaches are not just nightmares but everyday occurrences, two-factor authentication (2FA) stands as a critical layer of defense between our personal data and potential intruders. As the world grows increasingly interconnected through the internet, the traditional username and password system has shown its vulnerabilities. Passwords alone are like a single lock on a treasure chest; they can be picked, broken, or duplicated. That's where 2FA comes in, adding an extra lock to that chest, one that is uniquely keyed to something you have or something you are.

So why is 2FA important? Imagine a scenario where your password is compromised. Without 2FA, a cybercriminal with your password is essentially "you" in the digital realm, with full access to your emails, bank accounts, and personal files. With 2FA, the criminal hits a formidable barrier—they would need your phone, fingerprint, or a randomly generated code that only you can receive or generate. This added step is a powerful deterrent, as it significantly complicates unauthorized access. 2FA doesn't just double the security—it exponentially increases it because the second factor is often out of reach for attackers. 

Moreover, the psychological comfort that 2FA brings cannot be overstated. Knowing that your accounts have an additional layer of security can bring peace of mind in the troubling times of identity theft and financial fraud. It's a simple setup that could save countless hours and significant stress that would come from dealing with the fallout of a compromised account. Whether it's a text message code, a biometric scan, or a physical token, 2FA is a simple step for individuals and a giant leap in securing their digital identities.

The reassuring pat on the back that 2FA offers in the digital wilds is about to be shrugged off by some some project manager who, in a moment of misguided epiphany, decided that user convenience should trump security. 

Let's paint a picture: Your fortress of personal data is about to have one of its drawbridges lowered because someone in a boardroom determined that a few extra seconds of authentication might be the pea under the mattress of user experience.  Wonderful.

It's as if we're taking a giant leap backward in cybersecurity, all in the name of increasing Daily Active Users.  This is a metric, by the way, that means nothing when users' accounts are hijacked and their digital lives ransacked. This move to optional 2FA is akin to replacing your house's front door with a beaded curtain on the assumption that burglars will find it too tacky to pass through. 

Security should never be an afterthought, a begrudging nod to the paranoid. It should be the steel-toed boot you wear to kick hackers to the curb. Removing the need for 2FA on certain devices is not just removing a layer of security; it's handing out maps to the treasure and giving a wink to the pirates. 

This is a bad move, a faux pas in the masquerade ball of cybersecurity.  Bad Facebook, bad!
