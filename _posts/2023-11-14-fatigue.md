excerpt: "Fatigue has become an unexpected guest in my life, sneaking in from all sides. And it's not the kind of tiredness a good night's sleep can fix; it's a deeper exhaustion that builds up from constantly absorbing things I just can't ignore. Politics, climate change, tech upheavals, endless news cycles, even my recent tango with dengue—it all piles on. Some days, keeping it together feels impossible, and I'm a hair's breadth away from throwing my phone at the wall."

Fatigue has become an unexpected guest in my life, sneaking in from all sides. And it's not the kind of tiredness a good night's sleep can fix; it's a deeper exhaustion that builds up from constantly absorbing things I just can't ignore. Politics, climate change, tech upheavals, endless news cycles, even my recent tango with dengue—it all piles on. Some days, keeping it together feels impossible, and I'm a hair's breadth away from throwing my phone at the wall.

Opening up my regular news sites—BBC, ABC, Irish Times, RTÉ, PBS—feels like walking into a wall of political drama. No matter where I turn, it's all about U.S. politics. Elections, debates, endless policy squabbles...it's all-consuming. I used to dive into every headline, scrolling through analysis after analysis, but now I'm pulling back. I'm limiting my daily intake of political news to a lighter read on world updates, reminding myself the world will keep turning even if I miss the latest opinion piece or breaking headline.

The climate news hits close to home, literally. This year, Nepal saw devastating floods, and my family's house narrowly escaped disaster. Seeing the effects of climate change right at my doorstep changed everything. Now, I can't just read about it in the abstract; it's real and urgent. And yet, the cycle of disaster news is overwhelming. So, I'm focusing on small actions, like reducing waste and conserving energy at home. It's not going to solve the climate crisis, but it's a little antidote to feeling powerless.

The tech industry has been through a storm lately, and layoff news seems to be a constant headline in my feed. Every other day, it feels like another company announces job cuts. I've seen close friends, talented, hardworking people, lose their jobs, and it's a tough reminder of how fragile things are in a field I've invested so much in. I'm channeling that anxiety by helping where I can, connecting laid-off friends with hiring managers in my network. This rough patch will pass...at least, that's the hope.

After working in tech for a couple of decades, keeping up with every new library and tool feels like running on a never-ending treadmill. The pressure to stay updated is constant, and lately, I've been feeling it even more. Now, I'm taking a more deliberate approach: I don't jump on every new trend. I give myself space to see what sticks and what actually matters. It's not about catching every wave; it's about staying afloat without burning out.

Social interactions, especially online, have become more tiring since Covid, and living abroad from family only amplifies that. Between the notifications and endless updates, the pressure to always be “available” feels suffocating. Ironically, staying connected leaves me drained. So, I'm giving myself permission to disconnect. I've deleted all social media apps from my phone, turned off every notification, and only check in when I choose to. If someone really needs me, they know how to reach me, and my mental health has thanked me for it.

The more I read about global crises—natural disasters, social injustices, humanitarian emergencies—the more drained I feel. Living in Nepal, poverty is a constant reality, and sometimes, the compassion fatigue is real. It's tough to realize there's only so much you can give before you feel empty. I can't help everyone, but I can make a small difference in meaningful ways. I contribute where I feel it matters and organize crowdfunding here and there, but I'm learning that sometimes, stepping back is necessary.

Life's always going to throw challenges, but it doesn't have to be overwhelming. I'm learning to set boundaries, to pick my battles, and to manage this fatigue that keeps rolling in like waves. It's a continuous process, but hopefully one that teaches me resilience and the importance of self-care. Taking a step back isn't giving up, it's making room to come back stronger.
