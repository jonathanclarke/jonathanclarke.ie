Flesh and fire fill the night,

Rubble cradles the cries of the slain.

Empty cribs and shattered glass,

Each breath stolen as the warplanes pass.  
<br>  
  
Parents dig with bare, bloodied hands,

Ashes mask the childrenâ€™s faces.

Life reduced to a whispered plea,

Even hospitals and graves spared no mercy.

Silence roars louder than any scream,

Tents replace homes in a broken dream.

In the haze, a lullaby fades,

No stars shine in smoke choked skies.

Every tear etches a deeper scar.

<br>
