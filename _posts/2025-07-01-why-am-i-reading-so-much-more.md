I'll be honest - I never thought I'd be that person. You know, the one always rattling off book recommendations, banging on about their latest read like it's changed their life, and casually dropping author names like they're old mates. But here I am. Somehow this year, I've found meself reading more than I have in ages. And I'm absolutely loving it.

So, what changed?

### I got into Audiobooks

It started with audiobooks. At first, I thought, “Surely that's cheating?” Listening to someone else read the book while I'm out walking the dog or doing the driving the car didn't feel like proper reading. But I'll tell ya - it works. And it's brilliant.

Stick on a good narrator, and suddenly you're not just passing time, you're in it. Memoirs, nonfiction, even a bit of fiction now and then - they all go down easy when someone's telling you the story in your ear. I even caught meself getting emotional over a chapter while sdoing the most menial things.

I'm squeezing in whole books during times I'd normally be half-scrolling on the phone.

### The Kindle? We had a good run

Now here's the mad part: I ditched my Kindle.

Don't get me wrong - it had its glory days. Handy for holidays, light as a feather, and a whole library in me bag. But somewhere along the way, I started missing the feel of a real book. There's just something magic about turning pages, seeing how far you've come, and physically sticking a dog-ear in a chapter you want to come back to.

The smell, the texture, the weight of it. It's like your brain knows you're doing something worthwhile. And there's no poxy notifications or battery warnings to wreck your flow. Just you and the story.  I tend to stick a bookmark to mark my current place and another bookmark to indicate the start of the next chapter; challenging myself to finish the chapter as soon as I can.

I really got rid of the kindle for my kids; they were constantly seeing that I was using it but equated it to a tablet and not a book.  I abandoned it for them, I wanted them to see me reading, enjoying it as an activity so that they would see that it was normal to want to read, to enjoy and explore.  

### 25 Books? Go on, So!

Between the audiobooks and proper old-school paperbacks, I'm aiming to hit 25 books this year.  But the best part? It doesn't feel like work. I'm not forcing meself. I want to read. I look forward to it, like catching up with an old friend. It's become a proper joy again.

Growing up I always had a book in my hand; the past 10 years the habit has decreased, kids, life, work.  THe past few months, with a book in my hand it's suddenly spurred all sorts of conversations, recommendations from others. It's a great way to relax and enjoy a coffee. 

### However You Read - Just Do It

Whether you're listening on the go, flicking pages in bed, or still swiping away on your Kindle - fair play to you. It's not about the format, really. It's about making space for stories, ideas, and maybe even a bit of wisdom.

And if mixing it up like I did gets you reading more and loving it more? Then go for it.
