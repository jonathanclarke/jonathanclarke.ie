I stepped on the scale this morning and the number stared back at me, unblinking.

**109kg.**

I’m 43. I'm unfit. And honestly? My body feels every single one of those kilograms. The knees creak when I get up from the couch, the cholesterol numbers are moving in the wrong direction, and I'm constantly relying on medication just to keep things steady.

It's time to stop drifting.

I'm calling this **Project 300**.

## The Target

On December 6, 2026, I plan to be at the starting line of the **Fishtail Race** in Pokhara.

If you know Nepal trails, you know this isn't a gentle jog in the park. It's 25 kilometers of brutal, beautiful terrain. We're talking about 1,400 meters of elevation gain, ridge lines that make you dizzy, and endless stone steps that destroy your quads on the way down.

Trying to run that today? I wouldn't make it to the first checkpoint. I'd be gasping for air before I even left the lakeside.

To get there, I have roughly 300 days of actual, usable training time starting December 27th.

## The Plan

This isn't about getting a "beach body." I've got two kids and a serious weakness for a good mutton thali - I'm realistic. This is about capacity. It's about building a body that doesn't just survive the climb but actually enjoys it.

So, here is what the next 300 days look like:

**1. Dry January (to start)**

The holidays were incredible. We hosted a "Chosen Family" Christmas potluck here in Kathmandu, the house was full of friends, the food was amazing, and the drinks were flowing. But the sluggishness that follows? I'm done with it. Alcohol is the first thing to go. I need clear mornings and better recovery.

**2. The Grind**

I'm currently training on a treadmill that breaks down almost as often as I do, and an indoor bike. But the goal is to get out onto the actual hills around Lalitpur. You can't simulate Nepal's terrain in a gym. You have to feel the rocks under your feet.  HHHH - Himalayan Hash House Harriers to the rescue; I'm planning on joining the run in the last Saturday in January.

**3. The Health Metrics**
I want off the meds. I want the doctor to look at my cholesterol results and be bored. I want to be able to tie my shoes without making a noise that sounds like a deflating tire.

## Why Blog About It?

Because it's easy to quit when you do it in silence.

If I tell myself I'm going to train, I might skip it when it's cold and raining. If I tell *you*, whomeever you are, well I'm going to train, I look like an idiot if I don't follow through.

I'm going to share the ugly parts too. The days where progress stalls, the injuries (hopefully minor), and the days I just really, really want a beer.

300 days of discipline. 109kg starting weight. One big mountain to climb.
