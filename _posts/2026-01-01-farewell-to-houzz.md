I promised I wouldn't make a long speech! I just want to say that these past four and a half years have been an absolute adventure.

We've come a long way from the ConX days from building a jobs board to shipping a world-class Takeoff solution all the way to Houzz Pro.

Looking back, I don’t think about the features we shipped or the metrics we hit. I think about the team we've built.

To the engineers: thank you for your brilliance and your problem-solving.

To the QA team: thank you for your diligence and for keeping our standards so high.

And to the managers: you have made the hard days easier and the good days great.

A special thank you to Gary and Deepa. You have been the backbone of this operation. Your leadership has been exceptional, and I’m so grateful for your partnership.

Building software is hard, but building a team that cares about the work and each other is even harder - and you have done exactly that.

I am incredibly proud of the culture we’ve built here, especially here in Nepal.

People often say that leaders shape the team, but in my case, I feel like this team has shaped me.

I am leaving here a better manager and a better person because of the patience and dedication you all showed me.

I’m moving on to a new chapter now. I have a few actual mountains to climb (Fishtail 2026) and a very patient unread book collection to finally meet.

Leaving the company doesn't mean leaving you're actually getting rid of me. My phone is always on. If you ever need a reference, advice, or just a second opinion, I am only a message away. Your success will always be incredibly important to me.

Thank you for making these last four years the highlight of my career. This isn't goodbye, it's just 'see you later.'
