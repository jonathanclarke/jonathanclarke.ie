title: "To Australia Camp and back again; Or how to endure the gravity of giants"
excerpt: "To leave Kathmandu is to shed the city's chaotic gravity for the silent promise of the Annapurnas. We climbed to Australian Camp not to conquer the mountain, but to celebrate a milestone: my twins turning six and to my embarking on a new sabbatical. While I bargained with the jealous god of gravity on the stone steps, they bounded up as sparks of kinetic joy; a reminder that watching your children grow against a backdrop of eternal snow is to feel the devastating speed of time."

To leave Kathmandu is not merely a journey of distance, but of density.  You must peel yourself away from the sticky, chaotic gravity of the valley, shedding layers of dust and static as the highway unspools like a bruised ribbon beneath the wheels.  Construction constantly abounds for the first half, then, smooth roads after the goats are seeing heading up to their end in Manakamana.  The drive to Pokhara is a shedding of skin, a long, winding exhale that lasts all day, until the grey noise of the city is finally replaced by the silent, looming promise of the Annapurnas.

My family did not go to conquer the mountain; we went to introduce ourselves to it.  Our first family trek, hopefully one with a gentle slope. 

The trek from Ghatte Khola to Dhampus is a staircase carved by time and patience.  For someone trying to remember the language of his own body, every stone step was a syllable, a heavy punctuation mark demanding breath.  Gravity is a jealous god here.  It pulls at the calves and bargains with the lungs.  But we climbed and as we ascended, the air began to thin and sweeten, tasting less of exhaust and more of pine resin and cold stone.  The world simplified.  There was only the step, the breath, and the sky.

And there were my twins.

My girls turned six in the shadow of the giants.  This was their first birthday celebrated not with cake and sugar in a crowded room with flower showers, but with the earth beneath their ragged shoes and the wind in their hair.  Six is a such a magical threshold.  No longer toddlers stumbling through a mysterious world, but young explorers claiming it.  While I bargained with gravity, they seemed immune to it.  They were sparks of kinetic joy, bounding up the trail to Australian Camp as if the mountain were simply a playground built specifically for them by the gods.

To watch your children turn six against a backdrop of eternal snow is to feel the devastating speed of time.

At Australian Camp, the clouds performed their slow, theatrical dance, parting perfectly to reveal the jagged, white teeth of the Himalayas.  Machhapuchhre did not look like rock and ice; it looked like a frozen prayer piercing the blue; the fishtail was well named.  We stood there, our family of four, small and temporary against the geology of forever.

We celebrated with the currency of presence.  There were no notifications, no urgent emails, no deadlines.  Just the golden light of the afternoon hitting the grass, the laughter of our families of children who have just discovered they are strong enough to climb a mountain, and the silent approval of the peaks.

The descent back to Dhampus and subequently Ghatte Khola was a return to the heavier air, the knees singing the song of the descent, the brake of the body engaged against the pull of the earth.  My stick digging into the stone bending to my weight.  I gripped their hands over the loose stones, anchoring them against the pull of the slope, and wondered if this was the last time they would need my steadying, or if the next mountain would belong entirely to their own balance.  We carried the fatigue like a trophy.  Dandelions floated in the breeze aided with the breath of my children. 

We returned to the world of roads and engines, but we came back so much lighter, bonded tighter.  We left a year of childhood on the ridge, and we brought back the silence of the high places, tucked into our chests like a secret, enough to sustain us until the next journey.
