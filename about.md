# Things I like to talk about

I specialize in the "glamorous" world of software engineering, attempting to turn small, scrappy ideas into businesses that thrive more than survive. Resisting the goal of building a dynasty; the reality is mostly fixing merge conflicts and wondering if my code will outlive me (or just the current server subscription).

Silicon Peaks: Doing all of the above from Nepal. It's exactly like San Francisco, except the air is different, the rent is reasonable, and occasionally a monkey hangs out of your fiber cable.

I enjoy the thought of throwing myself up and down mountains, convincing myself that the burning in my lungs is "meditative" rather than a warning sign.

Currently navigating the precarious decade where a "good night's sleep" is a biological miracle and "stretching" is no longer optional but a requirement for basic mobility. I am essentially trying to outrun entropy.

Raising children in an era where the tablet can be a more effective parent than I am. I am constantly oscillating between "You need to learn to code" and "Throw that device in the river and go climb a tree."

Attempting to prepare my offspring for a future economy that doesn't exist yet, while hoping they don't just end up as prompt engineers for a robot overlord/billionaire.

I enjoy casual reading on the simultaneous collapse of both Western and Eastern civilizations. It pairs well with morning coffee.

Pondering how climate change will affect my children's future, mostly so I can apologize to them for everything we have done.

I practice "Patient Gaming," which is a polite term for buying video games on sale and promising to play them "when things quiet down." Spoiler: Things never quiet down.

I hold the scientifically unfounded belief that Ireland will eventually win the World Cup. It requires a level of faith usually reserved for religious zealots and stellar coin investors.

I am on a relentless, high-stakes quest to identify the absolute best Momo and Sequa in Lalitpur. This is not a hobby; this is a public service. If you see me demolishing a plate of momo, do not disturb me; I am working. Just join in.
