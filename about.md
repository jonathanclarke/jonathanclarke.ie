# Things I like to talk about

I specialize in the "glamorous" world of software engineering, attempting to turn small, scrappy ideas into businesses that thrive more than survive. Resisting the goal of building a dynasty; the reality is mostly fixing merge conflicts and wondering if my code will outlive me (or just the current server subscription).

I enjoy the thought of throwing myself up and down mountains, convincing myself that the burning in my lungs is "meditative" rather than a warning sign.

I'm navigating the precarious decade where a "good night's sleep" is a biological miracle and "stretching" is no longer optional but a requirement for basic mobility. I am essentially trying to outrun entropy.

Raising children in an era where the tablet can be a more effective parent than I am. I am constantly oscillating between "You need to learn to code" and "Throw that device in the river and go climb a tree."

Attempting to prepare my offspring for a future economy that doesn't exist yet, while hoping they don't just end up as prompt engineers for a robot overlord/billionaire.

I enjoy casual reading on the simultaneous collapse of both Western and Eastern civilizations. It pairs well with morning coffee.

Constantly pondering how climate change will affect my children's future, mostly so I can apologize to them for everything we have done and for unkept promises.

I practice "Patient Gaming," which is a polite term for buying video games on sale and promising to play them "when things quiet down." Spoiler: Things never quiet down and I'm still on my first Baldurs Gate 3 run. 

I hold the scientifically unfounded belief that Ireland will eventually win the World Cup. It requires a level of faith usually reserved for religious zealots and stellar coin investors.

While I was raised on a steady diet of classic Catholic guilt, I’m married to a Nepalese woman who seamlessly blends Hinduism and Buddhism, I’ve sat in Taoist contemplation in China, and found peace resting in mosques across the globe. But let’s be honest: my one true church has goalposts. The only scripture I strictly adhere to is the tribal warfare of hurling and the raw physicality of gaelic football. Ciarraí agus Cill Chormaic Cill Achaidh (KK) Abú!

I am on a relentless, high-stakes quest to identify the absolute best Momo and Sekuwa in Nepal. This is not a hobby; this is a public service. If you see me demolishing a plate of momo, do not disturb me; I am working. Just join in.

Doing all of the above from Nepal. It's exactly like San Francisco, except the air is different, the rent is reasonable, and occasionally a monkey hangs out of your fiber cable.
