This is the index page for all fitness related posts.  I'm attempting to complete 300 days of fitness as soon as possible to prepare me for an eventual half marathon, an ascent to multiple Nepalese mountains / base camps and to run around with my girls.  Here there be dragons, sore legs, lots of ranting, moaning, cursing and perhaps some decent advice among it all.  It'll be boring but hoping for it to be regular, cheer me on over at [mastodon](https://mastodon.ie/@jonathanclarke). 

You can follow along with my fitness journey by subscribing to my [fitness rss feed](https://www.jonathanclarke.ie/feed/fitness.xml).

I've managed to complete {{ page.fitness_session_count_2026 }} out of {{ page.fitness_target_count_2026 }} fitness sessions this year ({{ page.fitness_session_count_2026 | times: 100.0 | divided_by: page.fitness_target_count_2026 }}% of the way).
