In order to push myself this year I've vowed to increase my habit of reading dramatically this year.  I've found that in the past number of years I've been consuming a lot of social media, blog articles and news websites.  I've promised myself to start reading a lot more literature and finally complete a lot of the books that have been sitting on my bookshelf for some time now.


I've only read {{ page.book_count_2021 }} out of {{ page.book_target_2021}} books that I intend to consume in 2021.

A great book for any small business owner, something that many executives in larger companies could possibly adopt.  The advice by the founders is for founders, who want to keep their companies out of VC hands, small, lean and nimble.

I've already recommended this book to a number of people and I definitely plan to keep doing so.  It took me two days to read this one. 

Finished: 2020-01-02 - 2 days
