In order to push myself this year I've vowed to increase my habit of reading dramatically this year.  I've found that in the past number of years I've been consuming a lot of social media, blog articles and news websites.  I've promised myself to start reading a lot more literature and finally complete a lot of the books that have been sitting on my bookshelf for some time now.


I've only read {{ page.book_count_2023 }} out of {{ page.book_target_2023}} books that I intend to finish in 2023.
